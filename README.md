# Email Encryption System

_Hello and welcome to our project :)_

This project implements an email encryption system using three different encryption algorithms: Salsa20 for encryption and decryption, Elgamal for key delivery, and RSA for digital signature.

### Authors

## Usage
To use this system, simply put the message you want to encrypt in the Email_message.txt file. Then run the following command in your terminal:

```python
python main.py
```

This will encrypt your message using Salsa20, deliver the encryption key using Elgamal, and sign the message using RSA. The encrypted message, the encrypted key, and the digital signature will be saved in separate files.

We hope you find this project useful. 

Enjoy!
